=====

libKiCad is a compilation of footprints and 3d models of various electronics
components for the KiCad EDA (http://www.kicad.org/).

The footprint and 3d libraries are based on the Walter Lain's kicad library
(http://smisioto.no-ip.org/elettronica/kicad/kicad-en.htm).

In addition to the original libraries, the following improvements have been 
made:
+ The structure of the library have been changed to make it cross-platform
  (tested on Ubuntu and Windows).

        coolProject.pro
        coolProject.sch
        coolProject.brd
        ...        
    libkicad
        3d
            ...
        footprint
            ...
        README
	...

Open your project .brd file (e.g. awesomeProject.brd) in KiCad's pcbnew, go to
preferences > library, remove the default libraries and add all the .mod files
under libKiCad/footprint.

SCHEMATIC SYMBOLS
